# Introduction

## Network defination

A computer network is a collection of interconnected computing devices and systems that communicate with each other to share resources, information, and services. The primary purpose of a computer network is to facilitate communication and data exchange between different devices, allowing them to work together to perform various tasks and share resources efficiently. This interconnected system enables users to access and share data, applications, and other resources regardless of their physical location. These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies.

Key components and concepts in computer networks include:

Nodes:

- These are the individual devices or systems connected to the network, such as computers, servers, routers, switches, and printers.

Links:

- Links represent the communication pathways between nodes. They can be wired, like Ethernet cables or fiber optics, or wireless, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connections.

Topology:

- The network topology defines the physical or logical arrangement of nodes and links in a network. Common topologies include star, bus, ring, mesh, and hybrid configurations.

Protocols:

- Protocols are a set of rules and conventions that govern how data is transmitted and received over the network. Examples include Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet Protocol (IP), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

Data Transmission:

- Data is transmitted between devices in the form of packets. These packets contain the information being sent, along with addressing and control information.

Networking Devices:

- Devices like routers, switches, hubs, and repeaters are used to manage and control the flow of data within a network. Routers, for example, connect different networks and facilitate data traffic between them.

Network Services:

- Services like file sharing, email, web browsing, and remote access are made possible through the network infrastructure. These services often rely on application-layer protocols.

Security:

- Network security is crucial to protect data and resources from unauthorized access, attacks, and data breaches. Firewalls, encryption, and authentication mechanisms are common components of network security.

Internet:

- The Internet is a global network that connects millions of smaller networks worldwide. It uses a standardized set of protocols to enable communication and data exchange on a global scale.

Computer networks can vary in size and scale, ranging from small local area networks (LANs) within a single building to vast wide area networks (WANs) connecting geographically dispersed locations. The design and implementation of a network depend on factors like the intended use, size, and requirements of the connected devices.

## Basic components of a network

A computer network is comprised of various components that work together to enable communication and data exchange. These components can be broadly categorized into hardware devices, software components, and network protocols. The server, client, peer, transmission medium, and connecting devices are the hardware components. The operating system and protocols are software components. Here's an overview of the key components of a computer network:
